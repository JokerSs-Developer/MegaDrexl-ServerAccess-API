	ONLY EDIT THE SCRIPTS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
	LEAKING, COPYING OR ANYTHING SIMILAR WITHOUT MY PERMISSION CAN AND WILL BE REPORTED TO ROBLOX STAFF.
	
	Warning:
	Do NOT give access to people who are not Developers as they are NOT capable of knowing what it can do, what it does
	or how it works and how it can be exploited. Use with caution. Exploit attacks due to misuse are not my liability.

	Manual:
	
	Script names and their functions;
	
	Main - The body of the script, brains that execute the code for giving access to serversided features.
	Settings - DO NOT EDIT THIS MODULE, IT KEEPS ALL INFORMATION NEEDED.
	Allowed - Keeps UserIds for allowing access into the serversided features.
	
	How-to guide on adding personnel to serversided access:
	1) Open the "Allowed" module.
	2) Make a new line under the most recent UserID
	3) Put a comma on the end of the previous line (the line above the newly created one) right after the ending '
	4) Add your userId on the format: 'USERIDHERE'

	Example:
	
	'ExistingUSERID', --comma you created
	'YOURUSERID'
	
	and the cycle goes on.
	
	Maintaining the Script:
	For utmost safety, you MUST change the APIkey every now and then, the API key needs to be an MD5 Hash to work better.
	The version does not need to be changed as that is done by me when updates are launched.
	To reset the allowed list simply delete all the user IDs on the "Allowed" module.
